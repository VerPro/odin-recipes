<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These vegan brownies are made with cocoa powder for a rich and gooey chocolaty treat. If you prefer brownies that are a little more solid, you can bake the brownies for longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups of sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup good-quality cocoa</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water or coffee</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with baking spray; line bottom with parchment paper. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl until combined. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour in water (or coffee), vegetable oil, and vanilla; mix until well-blended. Spread batter evenly in the prepared dish. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until top is no longer shiny and center feels just set when gently pressed, about 30 minutes. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into 15 squares. Enjoy! </p>
